       "{'iphone 7': 'The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple. It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup, succeeding the iPhone 3GS and preceding the iPhone 4s. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple\\'s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.\\nThe iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple\\'s CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame that doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass. The iPhone 4 introduced Apple\\'s new high-resolution \"Retina display\" (with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch) while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its predecessors, Apple\\'s A4 system-on-chip, and with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and app folders. It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front-facing camera, which made possible Apple\\'s new FaceTime video chat service, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T\\'s period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.\\nThe iPhone 4 received a largely positive reception, with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware, in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success (with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours), the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way. Most direct contact with the phone\\'s outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength. Apple released iOS 4.0.1 to try to fix these issues, but were unsuccessful.\\nThe iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple\\'s flagship iPhone model at fifteen months. Although the succeeding 4S was announced in October 2011, the 4 continued to be sold as a midrange model until September 2012, and thereafter as the entry-level offering in Apple\\'s lineup until September 2013 with the announcement of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. The iPhone 4 had one of the longest lifespans of any iPhone ever produced, spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015.',\n",
       " 'tesla cybertruck': 'The Tesla Cybertruck is a battery-electric full-size pickup truck manufactured by Tesla, Inc. since 2023. It was first unveiled as a prototype in November 2019, featuring a distinctive angular design composed of flat, unpainted stainless steel body panels, drawing comparisons to low-polygon computer models.\\nOriginally scheduled for production in late 2021, the vehicle faced multiple delays before entering limited production at Gigafactory Texas in November 2023, with initial customer deliveries occurring later that month. As of 2025, three variants are available: a tri-motor all-wheel drive (AWD) model marketed as the \"Cyberbeast\", a dual-motor AWD model, and a single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) \"Long Range\" model. EPA range estimates vary by configuration, from 320 to 350 miles (515 to 565 km). \\nAs of 2025, the Cybertruck is sold in the United States, Mexico, Canada and South Korea. The Cybertruck has been criticized for its production quality and safety concerns while its sales have been described as disappointing.',\n",
       " 'tesla model s': \"Tesla, Inc. ( TEZ-lə or   TESS-lə) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures, and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to the inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla's first funding round and became the company's chairman, subsequently claiming to be a co-founder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022, and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\\nTesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world's most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh US company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2024, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 17.6% share. In 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\\nIn May 2025, Tesla again reached a valuation of $1 trillion, and has been a trillion-dollar company since. In November 2025, Tesla approved a pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk, which he is to receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.\\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk, including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'playstation 5': 'The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on 4 March 2000, in North America on October 26, in Europe on November 24, in Australia on November 30, and other regions thereafter. It is the successor to the original PlayStation as well as the second installment in the PlayStation brand of consoles. As a sixth-generation console, it competed with Nintendo\\'s GameCube, Sega\\'s Dreamcast, and Microsoft\\'s Xbox.\\nAnnounced in 1999, Sony began developing the console after the immense success of its predecessor. In addition to serving as a game console, it features a built-in DVD drive and was priced lower than standalone DVD players of the time, enhancing its value. Full backward compatibility with original PlayStation games and accessories gave it access to a vast launch library, far surpassing those of its competitors. The console\\'s hardware was also notable for its custom-built Emotion Engine processor, co-developed with Toshiba, which was promoted as being more powerful than most personal computers of the era.\\nThe PlayStation 2 remains the best-selling video game console of all time, having sold 160 million units worldwide, nearly triple the combined sales of competing sixth-generation consoles. It received widespread critical acclaim and amassed a global library of 10,987 game titles, with 1.54 billion copies sold. In 2004, Sony revised the console with a smaller, lighter body officially known as the \"Slimline\". Even after the release of its successor, the PlayStation 3, in 2006, it remained in production and continued to receive new game releases for several years with the last game for the system Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 being released in Europe in November 2013. Manufacturing officially ended in early 2013, giving the console one of the longest lifespans in video game history.',\n",
       " 'iphone 6': 'The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4s, and preceding both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012. The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 5\\'s design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the iPhone 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.\\nThe iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller 4-inch screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second iPhone after the iPhone 4s to include Apple\\'s new Sony-made 8 MP camera.\\nApple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, and over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and was described by Apple as \"extraordinary\", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone\\'s coating being prone to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple\\'s decision to switch to a different dock connector design, as the change affected iPhone 5\\'s compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line.\\nAlongside the iPhone 4, the iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5 has the joint second-shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple\\'s standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model. This was broken by the iPhone X which only had ten-months in production from November 2017 to September 2018, and tied with the iPhone XS which had twelve-months from September 2018 to September 2019. The iPhone 11 Pro and subsequent \"Pro\" designated iPhones have also had twelve month availability, being discontinued upon release of its successor.\\nThe iPhone 5 was replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5c; the 5c internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell. The iPhone 5 supports iOS 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The iPhone 5 does not support iOS 11 due to it dropping support for 32-bit devices. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s.',\n",
       " 'playstation 4': \"The PlayStation (codenamed PSX, abbreviated as PS, and retroactively PS1 or PS one) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, followed by North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and other regions following thereafter. As a fifth-generation console, the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn.\\nSony began developing the PlayStation after a failed venture with Nintendo to create a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the early 1990s. The console was primarily designed by Ken Kutaragi and Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan, while additional development was outsourced in the United Kingdom. An emphasis on 3D polygon graphics was placed at the forefront of the console's design. PlayStation game production was designed to be streamlined and inclusive, enticing the support of many third party developers.\\nThe console proved popular for its extensive game library, popular franchises, low retail price, and aggressive youth marketing which advertised it as the preferable console for adolescents and adults. Critically acclaimed games that defined the console include Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken 3, and Final Fantasy VII. Sony ceased production of the PlayStation on 23 March 2006—over eleven years after it had been released, and in the same year the PlayStation 3 debuted. More than 4,000 PlayStation games were released, with cumulative sales of 962 million units.\\nThe PlayStation signaled Sony's rise to power in the video game industry. It received acclaim and sold strongly; in less than a decade, it became the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units. Its use of compact discs heralded the game industry's transition from cartridges. The PlayStation's success led to a line of successors, beginning with the PlayStation 2 in 2000. In the same year, Sony released a smaller and cheaper model, the PS one.\"}"

    "### Q11: Estimate Content Quality of a Web Page\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Write a Python function that estimates the content quality of a web page based on its visible text. The function should return a score between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate better-written, more informative content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "Content quality is a key signal in search engine ranking. Pages with rich vocabulary, well-structured sentences, and minimal filler (e.g., stopwords) tend to be more useful to users and rank higher. This task simulates how search engines might heuristically assess page quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:**  \n",
    "   - Accept a string containing raw HTML content of a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Extraction:**  \n",
    "   - Use `BeautifulSoup` to remove `<script>` and `<style>` tags.\n",
    "   - Extract visible text and normalize whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tokenization and Preprocessing:**  \n",
    "   - Use `nltk.word_tokenize()` to split text into words.\n",
    "   - Use `nltk.sent_tokenize()` to split text into sentences.\n",
    "   - Filter out non-alphabetic tokens and lowercase all words.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Heuristic Scoring:**  \n",
    "   Compute the following metrics:\n",
    "   - **Average sentence length**: total words / total sentences  \n",
    "     (ideal range: 15–25 words per sentence)\n",
    "   - **Vocabulary richness**: unique words / total words  \n",
    "     (higher is better)\n",
    "   - **Stopword ratio**: proportion of stopwords in the text  \n",
    "     (lower is better)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Score:**  \n",
    "   Combine the metrics using weighted scoring:\n",
    "   - 40% weight for sentence length (normalized to 0–1)\n",
    "   - 40% weight for vocabulary richness\n",
    "   - 20% weight for inverse stopword ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output:**  \n",
    "   - Return a float score between 0 and 1, rounded to three decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "html_content = \"<html><body><h1>Welcome</h1><p>Python is a versatile language used in many domains.</p></body></html>\"\n",

    "#### Q6\n",
    "Keyword stuffing is a good technique to find inflated term frequencies given a keyword. This approach is very strong in considering which words are inflated given a threshold. There are some limitations to this however, such as long documents may be penalized due to their natural occurence of words that may appear a lot due to the fact that the document itself is large. An approach top fixing this weakness may be to implement a ratio of the term frequncy by the overall length of the document, and if this ratio exceeds a certain threshold, we can say that the keyword appears unnaturally in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7\n",
    "Finding out concealed keywords in css is useful due to the fact that we can find attributes that are invisible to users by parsed by crawlers. The algorithm is fast to execute and is good at catching common concelement techniques such as \"display:none\" and \"opacity:0\". A weakness this approach might have is that it can probably be evaded by creating more complex css strings, which would require more complex rules and domain knowledge by the developers trying to catch these techniques. One improvement may be to use regex patterns to account for similar hidden texts but with slight variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q8\n",
    "Cloaking detection is good for catching text which is different for the user and for the crawler, and using a similarity score to find how much they differ by. A weakness of this approach would be to access the crawler view which does not sound feasable in every scenario. Location based sites which change per region may be affected by the crawler view since it might not account for the different regions. One way to improve this algorithm might be to check html strings for more details on the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q9\n",
    "Doorway detection does a good job of finding common redirection patterns in html strings, it is fast in retrieval and efficient. There may be false positives in this scenario due to the algorithm catching very basic patterns, and a lot of legitimate sites may use redirects (such as mobile apps or portal logins). One improvement may be to only flag redirects which take 0 seconds, as that may be suspicious due to most notable websites giving a notice of redirect with a 5-second rate of redirection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q10\n",
    "Link spam detection is good at identifying artifical link patterns where the same URL is repeadetly used. It can use a threshold parameter which is adjustable by the user as well. The drawback to link spam detection is that it cannot properly catch link spam accross many coordinated sites, link quality is also not taken into consideration, since a high quality webpage may be used multiple times in the current webpage. This algorithm can be heavily improved by combining it with the content quality algorithm of links that are in the html tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q11\n",
    "Content quality is good in terms that it uses ratios such as the average sentence length, stopwords, and unique vocabulary richness to estimate the quality of a page. The weakness this algorithm has is that it may be biased towards a certain type of document. Since the rules are very hard-coded, the content quality estimation may for example rank healthcare documents higher than sports documents due to the fact that it has more unique words, and less stopwords. One improvement for this will be to have an algorithm to estimate thresholds (such as average sentence length), for different document topics such as sports, healthcare, film, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algotihm cannot also detect factual accuracy of a document which may be an issue due to the fact that innacurate documents should automatically be lower in quality. One fix could be to add source credibility to have a better estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q12\n",
    "Keyword density is good in terms of that it uses a ratio of term frequency by the length of the document to find inflated terms, rather than just the number of occurences by itself. A weakness is that it does not understand the semantic context of a document, and also it does not catch synonyms, or variations of a word (such a running, sprint, sprinting, and run are all similar). It can be improved using a thesauri and synonym expansion to find a more accurate score for the keyword density.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q13\n",
    "Link diversity of a webpage score is a good way of finding the link diversity of a webpage, by parsing the html tag and finding inflated links. It makes it easy to find pages that are repeats and spam urls. it cannot find the quality of the link however, and it may create false positives from verified links that have been cited multiple times in the webpage. We can improve this with our content estimation algorithm, by estimating the cited url's quality, and then flagging any occuring urls that have a low quality score."
