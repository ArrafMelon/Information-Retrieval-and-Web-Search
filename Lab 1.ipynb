    "Answer: The bag of words model represents documents as a collection of words. This stores the words as well as the frequency of the words from the document. Bag of words model is also unordered.\n",

    "Example: a document containing the sentence \"I love this this course\", bag of words would be represented by {\"love\":1,\"I\":1,\"this\":2,\"course\":1}\n",
    "\n",
    "It's role in vector space representation is that we can use the words and frequencies and store them in vectors, making them useful in mathematical calculations as normalization of a document, or applying algorithms to rank multiple documents.\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we know that TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) x IDF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in document d) x log(N / DF(t))\n",
    "\n",
    "For the TF(t,d) portion, it is simply calculating the number of terms t in a specific document, this means if we have a corpus of documents, we can find a TF score for each document for a specific term\n",
    "\n",
    "for the IDF(t) portion, it helps us understand how rare a term is across our corpus. This is because we divide the total number of documents by only the documents that contain term t. the log is more of a term to smooth the scaling, so rare terms may not be overweighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we multiple TF and IDF, the score we get tells us how important the term is in a specific document relative to the entire corpus. A high TF-IDF score tells us that the term appears more in the document relative to the corpus, and opposite happens when the TF-IDF score is low."

    "\n",
    "The point mentioned above is why cosine similarity is preferred over euclidean distance since euclidean distance factors in the magnitude of vectors. We may have a document that is similar to a query but large in magnitude (docA), and another which is not as similar, but smaller in magnitude (docB). Euclidean distance would tell us that docA is \"farther\" from the query than docB, which would not be correct."

    "\n",
    "1. for each term t in our query q, we divide the probability that t appears in relevant documents r, by the probability of t in non-relevant documents ¬r.\n",

The problem with TF-IDF is that is assumes that if a term is more frequently mentioned in a document, it is more important linearly. Another limitation is very long documents also contain multiple instances of a specific term, but that's just due to how long the document is, not because it is actually a relevant document. \n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 fixes these issues. Firstly, the problem with higher term frequency leading to higher relevance is addressed by a smoothing function (with parameter k1), which allows higher scores for higher frequencies, but quickly levels out. This is because extra occurrences may not add as much information after a certain point. \n",

    "1. Probabilistic models adapts to feedback. It can use user input to improve its ranking and update its probabilities on relevant/ non-relevant documents.\n",
    "2. The probabilistic model can incorporate frequency and document length to make its decisions. Other models may be naive in thinking that only term frequency itself matters, not accounting for the density of terms per document on relevance. Probabilistic models can fix that issue by introducing normalization and smoothing factors to account for overly long documents with terms appearing a lot of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. Probabilistic models such as BM25 require parameter tuning (for k and b). This may take some time to determine which combination of parameters work best when given the scenario.\n",
    "2. The initial results of a probabilistic model may not be accurate. This is because it has no previous knowledge on relevance. With user feedback, over time the model improves but it is not great in the beginning."
